# submerge

A simple subtitle merge program.

Initially created for merging downloaded subtitles for game of thrones, where I couldn't find subtitle files in which both the common spoken language as well as (translated) dothraki were included.
The subtitle files I found either only had subtitles for the common tongue but didn't include subtitles for dothraki scenes, or the other way around.

This tool takes two subtitle files and merges them to one. Options include adding forwards/backwards delay and coloring to the individual subtitles.
