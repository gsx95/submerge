# submerge

A simple subtitle merge program.

Initially created for merging downloaded subtitles for game of thrones, where I could'nt find subtitle files where the common spoken language as well as translated dothraki was included.
The subtitle files I found either only had subtitles for the common tongue (spoken in about 90% of the series) but didn't include subtitles for dothraki scenes, or the other way around.

This tool takes two subtitle files and merges them to one. Options include adding forwards/backwards delay to the individual subtitles and/or coloring all the lines coming from one of the subtitle files in a different, custom color.
